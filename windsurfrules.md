1. put a checkmark in the box next to the task when it is completed
2. when resuming work in a new chat:
   1. first verify all checked items [x] are still working
   2. then continue with the first unchecked item [ ]
3. if after repeated prompting about a task if it is still not working, then try a new technique or approach.
